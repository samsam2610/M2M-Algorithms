- Define and specify IMU and EMG windows’ parameters
- Get IMU and filter IMU data
- Get EMG data
    - Check for new maximum value in each channel’s window
    - Normalize EMG data by maximum value as it goes
    - Filter EMG data
- Get sensitive axis for Gyroscope and Accelerometer data for each window by 
    - Getting sum of all the absolute values in the window
    - The sensitive axis is the one with the highest sum.
- Analyze Gyroscope and Accelerometers sensitive axis data:
    - Use peak finding algorithm to identify peaks and its pointing direction
    - The pointing direction and the magnitude of the left tail-to-peak side are used along with the order among peaks can be used to determine heel-strike and toeoff from Gyroscope data.
    - The labels of the events are returned
- Analyze two EMG channels to determine peak as above as well as threshold to find contraction duration:
    - For each EMG channel, if the signal is above the threshold and the counting is not started, the duration starts to count.
    - If the counting is started and the signal is below the threshold, the counting stops and return “end” signal.
    - The labels of the events are returned
- The return labels from the process of analyzing gyroscope, accelerometers, and EMG data can be used to activate biofeedback signal.
